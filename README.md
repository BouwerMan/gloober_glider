# Line Follower Robot

This project is a line follower robot built using an Elegoo Hat and Arduino Uno for the EENG 3308 class. The robot uses a combination of motors and photo sensors to detect and follow a black line on a surface.

## Features

- **Motor Control**: The robot uses the `Motor` class to control the speed and direction of the motors.
- **Photo Sensors**: The `PhotoSensor` class is used to detect the black line and guide the robot's movement.
- **Obstacle Detection**: The robot halts when an obstacle is detected via the S2 pin.
